;;; Commentary:
;;
;; English helper with company interface.
;;
;; This module is base on https://github.com/wushuaibuaa/emacscompanywords
;;
;; I just write new function `toggle-company-english-helper'.
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put company-english-helper.el to your load-path.
;; The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;; It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'company-english-helper)
;;
;; And bind your key with function `toggle-company-english-helper'.
;;

;;; Customize:
;;
;;
;;
;; All of the above can customize by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET company-english-helper RET
;;

;;; Change log:
;;
;; 2018/07/20
;;      * Use `string-prefix-p' instead fuzz match, too many wrong candidates in completion result.
;;
;; 2018/07/06
;;      * First released.
;;

;;; Acknowledgements:
