;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides commands to toggle the visibility of Lisp
;; docstrings in code buffers.  It works with any major mode that uses
;; `font-lock-doc-face' for docstring highlighting and supports standard
;; s-expression navigation.
;;
;; The core idea is to reduce visual clutter when reviewing code structure,
;; refactoring, or studying codebases while keeping documentation readily
;; available when needed.
;;
;; The package uses Emacs overlays to hide text non-destructively: buffer
;; content is never modified, and all changes are purely visual.
;;
;; Key features:
;;
;; * Buffer-wide toggling of all docstrings
;; * Point-specific toggling of individual docstrings
;; * Configurable hiding styles (complete, partial, first-line)
;; * Debug mode to inspect detected docstrings
;; * Works with mixed fontification (like hl-todo)
;;
;; The detection algorithm is robust: it uses font-lock to identify
;; docstrings, then parses string literal boundaries to handle escaped
;; quotes and face splits correctly.  This works reliably across Emacs Lisp,
;; Common Lisp, Scheme, and other Lisp dialects.
;;
;; Basic usage:
;;
;;     M-x lisp-docstring-toggle           ; Toggle all docstrings
;;     M-x lisp-docstring-toggle-at-point  ; Toggle docstring at point
;;
;; With the minor mode enabled (default bindings):
;;
;;     C-c , t   ; Toggle all docstrings
;;     C-c , .   ; Toggle docstring at point
;;     C-c , D   ; Show debug information
;;
;; The prefix key C-c , can be customized via
;; `lisp-docstring-toggle-keymap-prefix'. For example, if you prefer
;; C-c C-d and it doesn't conflict with your major modes:
;;
;;     (setq lisp-docstring-toggle-keymap-prefix "C-c C-d")
;;
;; Customization:
;;
;; The hiding style is controlled by `lisp-docstring-toggle-hide-style':
;;
;; - `complete': Hide entire docstring (default)
;; - `partial': Show first N characters plus ellipsis
;; - `first-line': Show only first line plus ellipsis
;;
;;
;; The package draws inspiration from several places:
;;
;; - `hideif.el': Overlay-based hiding patterns
;; - `outline.el': Folding interface conventions
;; - `pel-hide-docstring.el': Partial visibility concept
;;
;; For detailed usage and customization, see the docstrings of:
;; - `lisp-docstring-toggle'
;; - `lisp-docstring-toggle-at-point'
;; - `lisp-docstring-toggle-hide-style'
;; - `lisp-docstring-toggle-mode'

  "A test docstrings.

In childhood, one imagines that any door unopened may open upon a wonder,
a place different from all the places one knows. That is because in childhood it
has so often proved to be so; the child, knowing nothing of any place except
his own, is astonished and delighted by novel sights that an adult would
readily have anticipated. When I was a boy, the doorway of a certain mausoleum
had been a portal of wonder to me; and when I crossed its threshold, I was not
disappointed")

  "How to hide docstrings when toggling visibility.

The value is a symbol, one of:

- `complete': Hide entire docstring content between quotes.  Only the
  ellipsis (if configured) is visible.

- `partial': Show the opening quote, first N characters of content, and
  closing quote.  The number of characters is controlled by
  `lisp-docstring-toggle-partial-chars'.  Useful for getting a quick
  sense of what the docstring contains.

- `first-line': Show the opening quote, first line of content, and
  closing quote.  Useful for docstrings with summary lines.

In all cases, the opening and closing quotes remain visible to maintain
visual context that a string is present.

Examples with a long docstring:

  complete:    \"[…]\"
  partial:     \"This is a comprehensive docstring ex[…]\"
  first-line:  \"This is a comprehensive docstring
               […]\"

This mode provides keybindings for docstring toggling commands.

\\<lisp-docstring-toggle-command-map>
\\[lisp-docstring-toggle] - Toggle all docstrings in buffer
\\[lisp-docstring-toggle-at-point] - Toggle docstring at point
\\[lisp-docstring-toggle-debug-show-docstring-snippets] - Show debug information

The prefix key is customizable via `lisp-docstring-toggle-keymap-prefix'.
For example:

    (setq lisp-docstring-toggle-keymap-prefix \"C-c C-d\")

The mode also ensures proper cleanup of overlays when the buffer is killed.

Enable this mode automatically in Lisp buffers with:

    (add-hook \\='lisp-mode-hook #\\='lisp-docstring-toggle-setup)"
